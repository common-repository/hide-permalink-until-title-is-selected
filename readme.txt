Enhanced Permalink Bar for WordPress core.

== Description ==

This Plugin moves the Permalink bar into a container that slides down when the user hovers over or selects the Title bar.
This reclaims the vertical space it currently consumes, de-clutters the user interface, and makes a few additional improvements to the bar such as removing truncation of the slug, changing the "Ok" button to "Save", and it makes the "Cancel" link a proper button.


== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire 'hide-permalink-until-title-is-selected' folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
